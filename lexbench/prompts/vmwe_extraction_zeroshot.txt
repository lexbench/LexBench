VMWE Definition: Verbal Multiword Expressions (VMWEs) are sequences of words in a language that exhibit idiosyncratic properties, such as orthographic, morphological, syntactic, or semantic irregularities, deviating from conventional grammar rules. These expressions typically consist of a verb as the head word and at least one other word with a syntactic relationship, often demonstrating non-compositionality in their meanings. While their individual components may have predictable meanings, the overall interpretation of a VMWE often cannot be inferred solely from its parts and syntax.
