      <p>
        In this task you are given a sentence with a highlighted span containing a phrasal verb.
        You are asked to identify whether the verb in the phrase is a "support verb". This happens when either:
      </p>
      <p>
        1) the phrase meaning comes mostly from the noun, and the verb itself is not used in its common meaning.
        For example, <i>take a shower</i> has most of its meaning from <i>shower</i>, and you don't actually take something.
      </p>
      <p>
        2) it is sometimes possible to replace the phrase with a single verb, which is often similar to the noun
        (e.g. <i>make a decision</i> can be rephrased as <i>decide</i>).
      </p>
      </p>

      <p>
        Note that the original phrase may have arguments and modifiers,
        for example, instead of <i>make a decision</i>, it can be <i>make a very difficult decision</i>.
        If you can't rephrase the arguments (e.g. there is not way to say "<i>decide very difficult</i>"),
        see if you can ignore them without changing the meaning of the sentence completely.

    <positive-example>
      <p>
        <i>He <mark>took a walk</mark> to the other side of the lake.</i>
        Most of the meaning comes from <i>walk</i>, and you can rephrase it to "<i>He walked</i>".
      </p>
      <p>
        <i>She <mark>took a deep breath</mark>.</i>
        Most of the meaning comes from <i>breath</i>, and you can rephrase it to "<i>She breathed</i>".
      </p>
    </positive-example>

    <negative-example>
      <p>
        <i>I think we should <mark>take the chance</mark>.</i>
        Most of the meaning comes from <i>chance</i>, but you can't rephrase to "<i>We should chance</i>".
      </p>
      <p>
        <i>She thrives in dynamic situations, <mark>taking charge</mark> and dealing with people.</i>
        Most of the meaning comes from <i>charge</i>, but you can't rephrase to "<i>charging and dealing</i>".
      </p>
