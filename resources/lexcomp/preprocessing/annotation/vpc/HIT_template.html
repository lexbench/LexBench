    <short-summary>
      <p>In this task you are given a sentence with a highlighted span, and asked to identify the span that
         holds the meaning of the action in the sentence - whether it is the entire highlighted span (<i>get through</i>)
        or just the verb (<i>get</i>).</p>
    </short-summary>
    
    <detailed-instructions>
      <p>In this task you are given a sentence with a highlighted span containing two words: a verb (e.g. <i>get</i>) and a preposition (e.g. <i>through</i>).</p>
      <p>You are required to identify which span holds the meaning of the action in the sentence: is it just the verb (<i>get</i>) or the
        entire phrase (<i>get through</i>)?</p>
      <p>As a rule of thumb, when the action is the entire phrase (<i>get through</i>), you may be able to think of a single-word verb
        that has the same meaning (e.g. <i>pass</i>), but it is not necessary that one exists.</p>

    <positive-example>
      <p><i>He nearly <mark>gave in</mark> to the temptation</i>: the verb is "give in".</p>
      <p><i>The example <mark>given in</mark> section 2 is very informative</i>: the verb is "give".</p>
    </positive-example>

  <div>
    <p><i>${sent}</i></p>
    <p>Which is the verb in the following highlighted span?</p>
    <input type="radio" name="answer" value="vpc" required> ${w_first} ${w_last}<br>
    <input type="radio" name="answer" value="non_vpc"> ${w_first}<br>
    <input type="radio" name="answer" value="incorrect"> I can't tell / the sentence does not make sense<br>
