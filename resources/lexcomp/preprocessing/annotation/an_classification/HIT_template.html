      <p>In this task you are given a sentence with a highlighted span containing a noun described by an adjective.
         You are asked to identify whether the adjective refers to a certain attribute of that noun,
         for example, <i>hot debate</i> refers to emotionality but not to temperature (as opposed to <i>hot tea</i>).</p>
